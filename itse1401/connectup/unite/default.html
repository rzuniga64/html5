	<p>
		You don't separate your personal life from your professional life, so why 
		should your networking site? ConnectUp helps you extend and combine your social 
		and professional networks. Other sites may allow you to make professional 
		contacts or stay in touch with your friends. But only ConnectUp mixes it up by 
		helping you socialize with your business colleagues and network with your 
		friends. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Strengthening your connections is the key to a happy life and a healthy 
		career. By joining ConnectUp and inviting your contacts to do the same, you can 
		socialize your way to success.
