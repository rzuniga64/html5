		<p>About Careers Guaranteed</p>
<p>Careers Guaranteed was started by three friends who realized that 
		typical job search sites simply weren&#39;t the most effective way to 
		advance a career. With thousands of anonymous, unknown, and perhaps 
		unqualified people flooding companies with resumes, the system was 
		definitely broken. Both job seekers and hiring managers needed a better 
		way to work. Over a late-night sushi dinner, the idea for Careers 
		Guaranteed was born.</p>
