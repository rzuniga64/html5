			<h1>Let us help you navigate</h1>
			<p>At Career Navigator, we only work with the best. If we accept 
			your application we guarantee that we will match you to a job 
			position or we refund your money.</p>
			<h2>Why we&#39;re different</h2>
			<p>You don&#39;t have any time to waste. You know how those other career 
			sites work. You post your resume. You spend hours sifting through 
			job postings. You apply to job after job after job. But it&#39;s tough 
			to get a foot in the door when hundreds of people are applying for 
			those same positions. At Career Navigator, we really get to know 
			you through our rigorous screening process. We know what your 
			strengths are and what you want out from your career. So we can 
			successfully match you with desirable positions in the industry 
			you&#39;d like to work in. </p>
