				<h1>Take the ConnectUp Challenge!</h1>
				<p>At ConnectUp we know we're connecting the smartest, most energetic people around.</p>
				<p>
					That's why we're challenging you to make ConnectUp even better by increasing your ConnectUp
					contacts.
				</p>

				<p>Sign up your friends, your business colleagues, your neighbors. For every five people you sign up,
					we'll make a donation to your choice of one of 10 charities. And we'll also enter you for a chance
					to win a trip to beautiful Bali!
				</p>

				<div id="sidebar">
					<h2>Take the Challenge and:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Meet new people</li>
						<li>Expand your business network</li>
						<li>Benefit a good cause</li>

					</ul>
				</div>

				<h2>What's in it for me?</h2>
				<p>
					Besides the great benefits we already mentioned, this is a chance to really focus on increasing your
					ConnectUp Network. By adding people to your network, you better your chances of finding that next
					great job, or at least that next great party.
				</p>
				<h2>What's in it for my friends and colleagues?</h2>
				<p>
					We'll also enter the friends and colleagues you sign up for their very own chance to win a $1000 gift
					certificate to amazon.com!
				</p>

				<h2>How long do I have?</h2>
				<p>You've got 3 weeks, buddy! Better get moving.</p>
