HTML5 Browser Support

HTML5 is not an official standard yet and not all browsers support HTML4 or at least some of the features of HTML5.
The base layout for an HTML document is the exact same. Flash is needed for advanced video processing and editing.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title> Page title </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p> Hello World! </p>
    </body>
</html>

Expanding HTML

One of the biggest reasons for HTML5 is to prevent users from needing to download and install multiple third party
plugins such as Flash and Silverlight. Some say HTML5 will repalce Flash.
